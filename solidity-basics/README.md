# Solidity Basics

### Why Solidity is Used for Smart Contracts

| Reason                             | Description                                                                                                     |
|------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Turing-Complete Language**       | Solidity is a Turing-complete language, meaning it can perform any computation given enough resources, making it versatile for various smart contract applications. |
| **Designed for Ethereum**          | Solidity is specifically designed for the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM), ensuring seamless integration and optimal performance on the Ethereum blockchain. |
| **Statically Typed**               | Being statically typed, Solidity allows for early detection of errors during compilation, improving code reliability and reducing runtime errors. |
| **High-Level Syntax**              | The syntax of Solidity is similar to JavaScript, which makes it relatively easy for developers to learn and use. |
| **Extensive Support and Libraries**| Solidity has extensive libraries and developer tools that facilitate the creation, testing, and deployment of smart contracts. |
| **Active Community**               | Solidity has a large and active community, providing a wealth of resources, tutorials, and support for developers. |
| **Security Features**              | Solidity includes various security features like modifiers and built-in functions to help developers write secure code. |
## Ether, Wei, and Gas in Ethereum


#### Ether and Wei

In the Ethereum network, transactions are paid with a currency called **ether**. Ether is divisible into smaller units, with the smallest unit being called **wei**. The conversion between ether and wei is as follows:

- **1 ether = 1e18 wei** (10^18 wei)

This is similar to the relationship between rupees and paisa in the Indian currency system:

- **1 rupee = 100 paisa** (1e2 paisa)

#### Gas

Gas is a unit that measures the amount of computational work required to perform operations on the Ethereum network. Each transaction in Ethereum incurs a gas cost, which is paid in ether. The key aspects of gas are:

- **Gas Price**: The amount of ether you are willing to pay per unit of gas.
- **Gas Spent**: The total amount of gas used by a transaction.

The total cost of a transaction in ether is calculated as:

- **Total Cost = Gas Spent * Gas Price**

Transactions with higher gas prices have higher priority for inclusion in a block. Any unspent gas is refunded.

There are two upper bounds on the amount of gas you can spend:

- **Gas Limit**: The maximum amount of gas you are willing to use for your transaction, set by you.
- **Block Gas Limit**: The maximum amount of gas allowed in a block, set by the network.



## IDE Used for Solidity
Remix is an integrated development environment (IDE) for Ethereum smart contract development. It supports writing, testing, and deploying smart contracts using the Solidity language. Accessible via a web browser, Remix offers debugging, compilation, and deployment tools for Ethereum developers.
